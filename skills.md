# Past Solutions

## DHCP4
https://github.com/krolaw/dhcp4 *Go*  
Open source DHCP IPv4 library.  I needed a Go native DHCP library for NuiNet/TrafficMate Pro, but there wasn't one available at the time.  The library was open sourced to benefit from community feedback. It was used by FaceBook in all of their datacentres for a time.

## Basic Facts

## Free Subliminal Text
http://github.com/krolaw/fst *Java*  
![Free Subliminal Text Example](../fst/screenshots.png)  
Multiplatform programme that flashes subliminal messages on screen. Created when my wife's subliminal software failed, and later turned into a fully releasable product.

## Hearts
![Hearts Example](../hearts/hearts.svg) *PHP, HTML, JavaScript, SVG*  
Hearts started with an interest in SVG and the imminent arrival of Valentine's day.  My wife blogged about it, which resulted in requests from SVG proponents to create a configurable version for general use.  A Canvas option was later added to support Android and iPhone devices.

## SipCloak
![SipCloak Logo](http://www.sipcloak.org/logo.png) *Go*  
Free, no registration, DNS controlled, SIP Redirection service. Sadly, no longer used as redirection isn't the best way to mask a SIP address.



# [Nui Software](https://nui.global) 



## NuiNet/TrafficMate
![TrafficMate Pro Screenshot](images/trafficMatePro.png)  
**TrafficMate:** *OpenWRT, Lua, HTML, CSS*  
**NuiNet:** *Debian, Go, HTML, CSS*

With the codebase (and developer) of previous versions scrapped, version 4 was an opportunity to get the foundations right and deliver a quality product to our customers. 

Two years on, the hardware was limiting development, so I took the opportunity to re-invent TrafficMate.
